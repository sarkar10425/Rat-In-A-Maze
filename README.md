# Rat-In-A-Maze

* While learning recursion and backtracking, students often encounter a famous backtracking question called "Rat in a Maze" , I thought of visualizing it.

* So I created a simple web app that shows all the path from top left to bottom right for a maze with obstacles.

* The constraints are :
In the project directory, you can run:

    * Rat can't go outside the maze
    * Rat can't pass through the red cell
    * Rat can go 1 step (up, down, right, left) at a time.

* The app is built with ReactJs.
