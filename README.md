# Rat-In-A-Maze
* So I created a simple web app that shows all the path from top left to bottom right for a maze with obstacles.

* The constraints are :

*1 Rat can't go outside the maze
*2 Rat can't pass through the red cell
*3 Rat can go 1 step (up, down, right, left) at a time.

* The app is built with ReactJs.
